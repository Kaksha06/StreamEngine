# StreamEngine

This project serves similar backend to that of youtube.
Designed and developed a scalable backend system for a video streaming platform with features like video upload, secure storage, and streaming, similar to YouTube. Implemented JWT-based authentication with hashed passwords and token expiration. Used MongoDB for managing users and video metadata, and Multer for handling large file uploads. Ensured secure and reliable API responses (200 OK) through thorough Postman testing. Built with performance, modularity, and FAANG-level backend standards in mind.

Tech Stack: JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, JWT, Multer, Postman, GitHub
